## How to Play
This is a single-player game where you control the snake to eat food that will be randomly placed on the screen. Your snake will keep growing longer with each piece of food it eats and will also get faster to make the game increasingly challenging.
The game ends if the snake collides either with the walls or with itself - the aim is to survive for as long as possible.
