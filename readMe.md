<h1 align='center'> My Simple Browser Based Snake Game üêç</h1>
<p align='center'>A basic game of the classic Snake, written in HTML, CSS and JavaScript.</p>

## How it Looks
![Game Screenshot](./images/screenshot.png)

## Description
This is a single-player game where you control the snake to eat food that will be randomly placed on the screen. Your snake will keep growing longer with each piece of food it eats and will also get faster to make the game increasingly challenging.
The game ends if the snake collides either with the walls or with itself - the aim is to survive for as long as possible.

### How to Play
Press the ‚¨ÜÔ∏è key to change the direction to upwards.

Press the ‚¨áÔ∏è key to change the direction to downwards.

Press the ‚¨ÖÔ∏è key to change the direction to left.

Press the ‚û°Ô∏è key to change the direction to right.

A fun game to play and a good example for a first time build with JavaScript!

## Requirements / Brief
The snake should be able to eat food to grow bigger.

The game should end when the snake hits the wall or itself.

Snake speeds up as it eats more.
